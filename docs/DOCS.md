Idea:

```
This document outlines a blockchain-based system designed to bring transparency and accountability to the disaster relief supply chain. It acts as a foundational reference for all project documentation.

### Core Idea

The fundamental concept is to create a trusted, transparent, and immutable digital logbook for physical aid shipments. By representing each donation batch as a unique digital asset (like an NFT) on a blockchain, the system allows donors, relief organizations, and the public to track goods from the initial donation point to the final recipient, ensuring that aid reaches its intended destination.

### How It Works: The Lifecycle of a Shipment

The process is broken down into three main phases, creating a verifiable digital journey that mirrors the physical one.

**1. Shipment Creation (Minting an NFT for Aid)**
When a relief organization receives goods from a donor, it initiates the tracking process:
*   **A unique digital record is created:** This record, similar to an NFT, is assigned a unique Shipment ID for the batch of goods (e.g., "500 blankets, 100 food kits").
*   **Initial data is logged on-chain:** Key details like the description of goods, quantity, and packaging information are recorded.
*   **Supporting media is stored:** Photos of the goods, documents, and a unique QR/NFC tag are linked to the record via a hash from the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
*   **The record becomes public and immutable:** Once created, this initial entry can be viewed by anyone through a public dashboard or blockchain explorer, but it cannot be altered.

**2. In-Transit Updates (Checkpoint Scans)**
As the shipment travels through the supply chain (e.g., from a warehouse to a port, across a border, to a local depot), its journey is updated:
*   **Scans trigger on-chain updates:** At each checkpoint, authorized personnel (e.g., warehouse staff, logistics drivers, customs officers) scan the package's QR/NFC tag.
*   **Real-time data is recorded:** Each scan logs the GPS location, a timestamp, and the wallet address of the person who scanned it. An optional photo can be added to verify that the shipment's seals are intact.
*   **Updates are secure and authorized:** Only pre-verified individuals or organizations are given authorized digital wallets that can make these updates.

**3. Final Delivery and Confirmation**
The final step closes the loop on the shipment's journey:
*   **Arrival is marked:** A local relief worker at the final distribution point scans the QR/NFC tag to mark the shipment as "Arrived."
*   **Proof of delivery is uploaded:** A delivery confirmation is submitted, which can include a final photo of the goods with the recipients, a timestamp, and GPS coordinates.
*   **The record is closed:** This final event, sometimes confirmed by a second independent verifier (like a local community representative), marks the shipment as "Delivered" and closes its blockchain record.

### How Visibility is Guaranteed

Transparency is the system's cornerstone, achieved through a public-facing dashboard. This dashboard functions like a parcel tracking page but is tailored for disaster relief. It allows anyone, especially donors, to:
*   **View the complete journey:** See the shipment's path from origin → current location → delivered.
*   **Verify every step:** All logs, from creation to final delivery, are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
*   **Access detailed proof:** Users can click on a specific Shipment ID to see all checkpoint scans, photos, and confirmations associated with it.

### Who Handles the Real-World Operations?

The blockchain itself does not move physical goods. It serves as the single source of truth that all parties can trust. The real-world logistics are handled by:
*   **Relief NGOs:** Organizations like the Red Crescent may manage their own logistics.
*   **Third-Party Logistics Providers:** NGOs can also contract external logistics companies.

In either case, the entity responsible for the physical handling is granted an authorized wallet, allowing them to update the shipment's status on the blockchain at each key handover point.
```

Tech Stack:

```
Excellent, let's architect a robust and scalable tech stack for the Disaster Relief Tracker, building on the unique capabilities of the Oasis Network.

This plan is designed to be modular, secure, and transparent, leveraging the best tools for each part of the system.

### Guiding Principles

*   **Privacy by Design:** While the goal is transparency, certain data (like recipient identities or sensitive operational details) must be kept confidential. Oasis Sapphire is perfect for this.
*   **Developer Experience:** We will prioritize familiar tools and languages to accelerate development. The EVM compatibility of Oasis Sapphire is a major advantage here.
*
*   **Decentralization and Immutability:** Core shipment data will be stored on-chain for maximum integrity. Large media files will be stored decentrally on IPFS.
*   **User-Centricity:** The public dashboard and tools for relief workers must be intuitive and easy to use, even in challenging environments.

---

### Tech Stack Breakdown

Here is a component-by-component plan for the technology stack:

#### 1. Blockchain Layer: Oasis Sapphire ParaTime

Oasis is the ideal foundation due to its unique architecture that separates consensus from computation into layers, allowing for specialized "ParaTimes."

*   **ParaTime Choice: Oasis Sapphire**. We will build on Sapphire, the official confidential ParaTime that is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
    *   **Why Sapphire?**
        *   **Confidentiality:** It allows for the creation of confidential smart contracts where sensitive data can be processed without being exposed to the public or even the node operators running the network. This is crucial for handling potentially sensitive delivery information while keeping the core logistics transparent.
        *   **EVM Compatibility:** This is a huge advantage. We can use the world's most popular smart contract language, **Solidity**, and leverage the extensive ecosystem of developer tools like Hardhat, Truffle, and libraries like ethers.js. This dramatically speeds up development and makes it easier to find developers.
        *   **Performance and Cost:** Sapphire boasts low gas fees (over 99% cheaper than Ethereum) and high throughput, which is essential for a system that will log numerous updates for many shipments.

#### 2. Smart Contracts

*   **Language: Solidity.** The de facto language for EVM chains. Its maturity and extensive developer support make it the logical choice.
*   **Core Logic:**
    *   **Shipment NFT (ERC-721):** Each shipment batch will be represented as a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT). The `ShipmentID` will be the `tokenID`. This provides a standard way to track ownership and transfer of responsibility.
    *   **ShipmentRegistry Contract:** This will be the main contract. It will handle:
        *   Minting new shipment NFTs.
        *   Storing on-chain data for each shipment: `description`, `origin`, `destination`, `status` (Created, In-Transit, Delivered), and the current `custodian` (an authorized wallet address).
        *   An array or mapping of checkpoint updates, each containing a `timestamp`, `GPS coordinates`, the `scanner's wallet address`, and a link to off-chain data.
        *   Access control modifiers to ensure only authorized wallets (NGOs, logistics partners) can create shipments or add updates.
*   **Development & Deployment Tools:**
    *   **Hardhat:** A professional development environment for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging Solidity smart contracts. It has excellent support for testing on local networks and deploying to testnets and mainnets.
    *   **Oasis-Sapphire Hardhat Plugin:** A specific plugin to seamlessly integrate Hardhat with the Sapphire network.

#### 3. Decentralized File Storage: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

For storing photos and documents, which are too large and expensive for direct on-chain storage, IPFS is the perfect solution.

*   **How it Works:** We will upload photos (of goods, packaging, delivery confirmations) and any relevant documents to IPFS. IPFS will return a unique content identifier (CID), or hash.
*   **Integration:** This IPFS hash is what gets stored on the blockchain in the corresponding checkpoint update. It's a small, fixed-size piece of data that immutably links to the off-chain file.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **NFT.Storage / Pinata / Fleek:** These services provide easy-to-use APIs for uploading files to IPFS and ensure the data is "pinned" (i.e., guaranteed to remain available). This simplifies the process for the front end and back end.

#### 4. Frontend (Web Dashboard & Mobile App)

This is the public-facing component that brings the data to life. It will serve donors, the public, and act as the interface for relief workers.

*   **Framework: React or Next.js.** These are modern, powerful JavaScript frameworks for building fast, responsive user interfaces. Next.js is particularly good for its server-side rendering capabilities, which can improve performance and SEO for the public dashboard.
*   **Blockchain Interaction:**
    *   **Ethers.js / Viem:** JavaScript libraries to interact with the deployed smart contracts on the Oasis Sapphire chain. They will be used to read shipment data for the dashboard and to send transactions (e.g., confirming delivery) from authorized users' wallets.
*   **Wallet Integration:**
    *   **MetaMask / Oasis ROSE Wallet:** The application will need to connect to users' wallets. Since Sapphire is EVM-compatible, standard wallets like MetaMask can be used to manage the authorized wallets for relief workers. The official ROSE Wallet also offers support.
    *   **WalletConnect:** To support a wide range of mobile and desktop wallets.

#### 5. Backend & Middleware

While the system is decentralized, a traditional backend server can simplify and enhance the user experience.

*   **Language: Node.js (with Express.js or Nest.js).** A JavaScript-based backend is a natural fit with a React/Next.js frontend and libraries like ethers.js.
*   **Key Roles:**
    *   **API for Frontend:** Provide a simplified API for the frontend to query formatted blockchain data. This can be faster than having the client make multiple direct calls to the blockchain node.
    *   **User/Wallet Management:** Manage the list of authorized wallets for NGOs, logistics partners, etc. While the authorization logic is on-chain, this server can provide a user-friendly interface for an administrator to grant and revoke roles.
    *   **IPFS Upload Handling:** The frontend can upload images to the backend server, which can then process them (e.g., resize, compress) before pinning them to IPFS. This provides a better user experience and more control.
    *   **Caching & Indexing (Optional but Recommended):** Services like **The Graph** could be used to index events emitted by our smart contracts. This allows the frontend to query historical data much more efficiently than by scanning the blockchain directly.

### Development & Deployment Workflow

1.  **Setup:** Install Node.js, Hardhat, and the Oasis CLI tool.
2.  **Contract Development:** Write the Solidity smart contracts and comprehensive tests using Hardhat.
3.  **Local Testing:** Deploy and test the contracts on a local Sapphire testnet to simulate the entire workflow without incurring gas fees.
4.  **Frontend Development:** Build the React/Next.js dashboard, integrating ethers.js to communicate with the local testnet contracts.
5.  **Testnet Deployment:** Deploy the contracts to the public Oasis Sapphire Testnet. Fund wallets with testnet ROSE tokens from a faucet to conduct end-to-end testing in a shared environment.
6.  **Backend Development:** Build the Node.js server to handle user management and IPFS uploads.
7.  **Mainnet Deployment:** After thorough testing and audits, deploy the final contracts to the Oasis Sapphire Mainnet. Update the frontend and backend to point to the mainnet contracts.

17) Success metrics (UX)
- Time to log a checkpoint (target: <15s after scan, online; <25s offline)
- Scan success rate (first-try >95%)
- Offline queue completion rate (>98% within 1 hour of connectivity)
- Public verification actions (click-through to on-chain) and share link usage
- Support tickets related to wallet/permissions (trend down)

18) Example microcopy
- Scan screen: “Align QR in the frame. No QR? Enter ID manually.”
- Checkpoint success: “Update recorded. View on chain →”
- Offline saved: “Saved offline (1). We’ll sync when back online.”
- Permissions: “We only use your location at the moment you log a checkpoint.”

19) Risks and mitigations
- Wallet friction: default to relayer/gas sponsorship; one-tap connect; persistent session
- Connectivity: robust offline queue; retries; minimal payloads
- Map performance: lazy load; low-detail tiles; list fallback
- Privacy: explicit public/private markers; only necessary data exposed by default

If helpful, I can turn this into:
- Low-fidelity wireframes for each core screen (mobile and desktop)
- A design token sheet (colors, typography, spacing) and component inventory
- A click-through prototype of the Scan → Checkpoint → Submit flow
- An issue breakdown for engineering execution (tickets per milestone)

## 7. Migration & Upgrade Strategy

### 7.1 Smart Contract Upgrades

**Upgrade Patterns:**
- Proxy pattern (UUPS preferred)
- Storage gap management
- Version tracking
- Migration scripts
- Rollback procedures

### 7.2 Data Migration

**Migration Approach:**
- Blue-green deployments
- Database versioning (Flyway)
- Backward compatibility period
- Data validation post-migration
- Rollback capabilities

## 8. Disaster Recovery

### 8.1 Backup Strategy

**Data Backup:**
- Database: Daily snapshots, point-in-time recovery
- IPFS: Multiple pinning services
- Blockchain: Archive node backups
- Configuration: Version controlled

### 8.2 Recovery Procedures

**RTO/RPO Targets:**
- RTO: 4 hours
- RPO: 1 hour
- Automated failover where possible
- Documented manual procedures
- Regular disaster recovery drills

This architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation that can start simple in local development and scale to production-grade infrastructure while maintaining the core principles of transparency, security, and usability for disaster relief operations.
