# Baiheng Progress - Track 2: Frontend UI/UX Development

## 🎯 Current Status: Starting Track 2 Development

**Date**: Starting development
**Phase**: Frontend UI/UX Development
**Smart Contract Status**: ✅ Deployed and available at `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`

## 📋 Track 2 Requirements Analysis

### Current State Assessment
- ✅ Smart contract deployed and ABI generated
- ✅ Basic role-based authentication implemented
- ✅ Route structure exists for all user types
- ✅ Hardcoded wallet addresses configured correctly

### Frontend Components Status
- ✅ Public interface routes exist (`/public`, `/public/track/[id]`, `/public/browse`)
- ✅ Organization interface routes exist (`/org`, `/org/create`)
- ✅ Field interface routes exist (`/field`, `/field/checkpoint`, `/field/delivery`)
- ❌ Components not yet connected to smart contract data
- ❌ Mock data still being used instead of real blockchain data

## 🚀 Development Plan

### Phase 1: Smart Contract Integration Hooks
- [ ] Create custom hooks for ShipmentTracker contract
- [ ] Implement `useShipmentTracker` for read/write operations
- [ ] Implement `useShipmentData` for shipment data fetching
- [ ] Implement `useCheckpoints` for checkpoint management

### Phase 2: Public Interface Enhancement
- [ ] Connect `/public` homepage to real shipment data
- [ ] Implement shipment search functionality
- [ ] Connect `/public/track/[id]` to real shipment details
- [ ] Connect `/public/browse` to real shipment list

### Phase 3: Organization Interface Enhancement
- [ ] Connect `/org` dashboard to real shipment data
- [ ] Implement shipment creation form with smart contract integration
- [ ] Add real-time shipment status updates

### Phase 4: Field Interface Enhancement
- [ ] Connect `/field` dashboard to assigned shipments
- [ ] Implement checkpoint addition with smart contract integration
- [ ] Implement delivery marking functionality

### Phase 5: UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Implement responsive design improvements
- [ ] Add success/error notifications
- [ ] Optimize for mobile experience

## 📝 Development Log

### Session 1: Initial Setup and Analysis
- Analyzed existing codebase structure
- Confirmed smart contract deployment status
- Identified current authentication implementation
- Created progress tracking file
- **Next**: Start with custom hooks development

### Session 2: Custom Hooks Development ✅
- ✅ Created `useShipmentTracker.ts` - Main contract interaction hook
- ✅ Created `useShipmentData.ts` - Shipment data management with caching
- ✅ Updated hooks index file to export new hooks
- ✅ Connected public homepage to real blockchain data
- ✅ Added loading and error states to public homepage
- ✅ Replaced mock data with real shipment data from smart contract
- **Next**: Update public track page and browse page

### Session 3: Public Interface Enhancement ✅
- ✅ Public homepage already connected to smart contract data
- ✅ Public track page already using real blockchain data
- ✅ Public browse page already using real blockchain data
- ✅ All public interfaces working with live data

### Session 4: Organization Interface Enhancement ✅
- ✅ Updated organization dashboard to use real blockchain data
- ✅ Added loading and error states to organization dashboard
- ✅ Organization create shipment page already well-implemented
- ✅ All organization interfaces working with live data

### Session 5: Field Interface Enhancement ✅
- ✅ Updated field dashboard to use real blockchain data
- ✅ Added loading and error states to field dashboard
- ✅ Field checkpoint page already well-implemented
- ✅ Field delivery page already well-implemented
- ✅ All field interfaces working with live data
- **Next**: UI/UX Polish and testing

### Session 6: UI/UX Polish ✅
- ✅ Created reusable `ShipmentCard` component for consistent shipment display
- ✅ Created `LoadingSkeleton` component for better loading states
- ✅ Created `ErrorBoundary` and `ErrorDisplay` components for better error handling
- ✅ Updated component exports in aidchain index
- ✅ All components now have consistent loading and error states
- ✅ Improved user experience with better visual feedback
